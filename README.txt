travel-data is an application that allows a user to input specific parameters to filter flight data via the Amadeus API
and receive the API response in a human-readable format.

Attached in the same directory as travel-data is SWENG861_Flight_Data_Project.png which is an image of a block diagram 
representative of the data flow within the application. There is also Zarvis_flight_info_project_display.JPG which is 
an image of the display for hopefully easy recognition of the project at a glance.

How to run travel-data:
-Clone/download the repository at https://github.com/Zarkos99/sweng861PROJECT/tree/main
-Run the executable .jar file named travel-data-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar under sweng861PROJECT/travel-data/target
    -NOTES: 
        -I don't believe this executable is cross-platform so it likely will only work on windows (x64?). 
            I don't have a mac or linux system to test that theory.
        -I tested this using JDK-20.0.1 so I recommend using that version when trying to run this project.
